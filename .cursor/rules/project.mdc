## About the Project

This is a brutalist, text only website. There are no backgrounds, images, borders, underlines, icons, or other ornaments unless explicitly mentioned. All text is the same size and same weight. The goal is a noncomplex design that showcases Next.js. Unique colors will be used in different components to highlight their use.

## Important Code Instructions

- Be terse. Do not try to create code that is not asked for. Do not create examples.
- This project uses the latest version of Next.js 15. Remember that things like params, cookies, and headers are promises
- We are not using shadcn. Do not suggest shadcn components or radix packages. Keep components simple and native whenever possible
- We will use experimental features like PPR
- This project uses Tailwind 4 and should never create a tailwind.config.ts file
- The app directory is only for layout/page/route files only
- html color names should be used for styling, like `bg-[black]` or `text-[lime]`
- Unless specified, margin should never be used. Vertical rhythm should use gap classes in parent elements.

## Code Style

- Prefer a named function over a const
- Prefer the receive object return object (RORO) pattern for functions
- Prefer components/component-name/index.tsx over components/component-name.tsx
- Alphabetize when possible
- Client only libs should go in lib/**/client.ts, server only libs should go in lib/**/server.ts, server actions should go in lib/**/actions.ts, and isomorphic libs should go in lib/**/index.ts
