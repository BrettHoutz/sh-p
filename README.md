## Ship/Shop

This app was created for the "Elevate Your Ecommerce" workshop at Vercel Ship 2025. It was created to show off some features that have helped people build production grade composable commerce code that is relevant, performant, and manageable.

### Up and Running

Once you have successfully pulled down the repository locally, you can use the following steps to get it up and running:

1. Run `pnpm i` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. You can grab an environment file from https://env.shipworkshopshop.com and copy and paste that information into a .env.local file at the root of the directory. **Note:** The OIDC token might be out of date. It will be up to date on the day of the workshop.
3. Run `pnpm dev` to get the site up at `http://localhost:3000` or `pnpm dev:https` to get the site up and running at `https://localhost:3000`
4. Visit the site in your browser.
